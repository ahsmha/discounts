# Unifize Discount Service Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Assignment Completion Status

✅ **Core Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Brand-specific discounts (e.g., "Min 40% off on PUMA")
- ✅ Category-specific deals (e.g., "Extra 10% off on T-shirts")  
- ✅ Bank card offers (e.g., "10% instant discount on ICICI Bank cards")
- ✅ Voucher codes (e.g., 'SUPER69' for 69% off)
- ✅ Proper discount stacking order implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive business rule validation
- ✅ Table-driven tests with realistic scenarios

✅ **SOLID Principles Implementation:**
- ✅ Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear job
- ✅ Open/Closed: Extensible without modifying existing code
- ✅ Liskov Substitution: All implementations are interchangeable
- ✅ Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
- ✅ Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

✅ **Clean Architecture:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns across layers
- ✅ Business logic isolated from infrastructure
- ✅ Dependency injection for loose coupling
- ✅ Testable and maintainable code structure

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Layer Structure:
```

├── main.go          # Bootstrap and demonstration

internal/            # Private application packages
├── models/          # Domain entities and business rules
├── service/         # Business logic layer
├── repository/      # Data access abstraction
└── config/          # Configuration management

pkg/                 # Reusable packages
└── errors/          # Custom error types

testdata/           # Test scenarios and sample data
└── fake_data.go    # Realistic test data

test/               # Integration tests
└── integration/    # End-to-end testing
```

### Key Components:
1. **DiscountService**: Main orchestrator for discount calculations
2. **DiscountCalculator**: Handles discount amount calculations
3. **DiscountValidator**: Manages business rule validation
4. **DiscountRepository**: Abstracts data access layer
5. **Models**: Rich domain entities with business logic

## 📊 Test Scenario Results

### Multiple Discount Scenario (Assignment Example):
- **Input**: PUMA T-shirt (₹1000 x 2 = ₹2000)
- **Customer**: Premium tier
- **Payment**: ICICI Bank Card

### Applied Discounts (Stacking Order):
1. **Brand Discount**: PUMA 40% off = ₹800 savings
2. **Category Discount**: T-shirts 10% off = ₹120 savings  
3. **Bank Discount**: ICICI 10% off = ₹108 savings

### Final Result:
- **Original Price**: ₹2000
- **Final Price**: ₹972
- **Total Savings**: ₹1028 (51.4%)
- **Discounts Applied**: 3 different types

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Test Categories:
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing
3. **Table-Driven Tests**: Comprehensive scenario coverage
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Error handling and validation

### Test Scenarios:
- ✅ Empty cart handling
- ✅ Multiple discount stacking
- ✅ Customer tier restrictions
- ✅ Minimum amount requirements
- ✅ Maximum discount limits
- ✅ Bank offer validation
- ✅ Voucher code validation
- ✅ Product exclusion rules

## 🔧 Code Quality Features

### Error Handling:
- Custom error types for different scenarios
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful failure handling
- Context-aware error propagation

### Performance Optimizations:
